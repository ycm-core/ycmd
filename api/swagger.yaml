    ycmd is a code-completion & code-comprehension server.

    ycmd presents a JSON/REST interface to clients over HTTP, validated by HMAC.
    An instance of ycmd is started for each client application.

    ## General Notes

    The REST interface typically uses HTTP POST requests and expects the payload
    data to be a valid JSON document. The following general principles are
    applied:

    - All strings going into and out of the server are UTF-8 encoded.
    - All line and column numbers are 1-based, not 0-based. They are also byte
      offsets, not Unicode codepoint offsets.
    - All file paths are full, absolute paths. If a file has not been written
      to disk yet, supply a temporary path.
    - All requests to the server must include an HMAC in the x-ycm-hmac HTTP
      header.
    - All responses from the server must be validated using the x-ycm-hmac
      header.

    ## The example client

    ycmd contains a simple example client in the `example` directory of the
    source tree. It is written in pure Python with only minimal dependencies.
    It contains trivial implementations of most endpoints and serves to
    supplement this API documentation.

    Consult `example/README.md` for instructions on getting it running.

    ## Starting the server

    The ycmd server is typically started by a client in order to provide
    services to it. Briefly, starting the server requires supplying some
    configuration and initializing some security features (HMAC).

    The server should be started with a supported version of Python.

    The full list of command line options can be obtained by passing `--help`
    to ycmd (e.g. `python -m ycmd --help`). However, the following
    options warrant further discussion:

    ### `--options_file`

    This mandatory option supplies the name of a file containing user options
    data. This option (and thus the file) are mandatory, as they are required
    to set the shared HMAC secret.

    Once the server has read the options, the server deletes the options file.
    Therefore, the client should typically create a secure temporary file (e.g.
    `mkstemp`) which contains the options to be used.

    The default options and their values are found in `default_settings.json`
    within the ycmd codebase.

    The file contains a JSON-formatted object, where the keys are the names of
    options (with any `ycm_` prefix removed) and the values are the option
    values.

    The canonical list of supported user options can be found in
    YouCompleteMe's `README.md`. The option values should have the `ycm_`
    prefix removed.

    The following additional options are required to be set by the client
    application and should *not* be visible to the user:

      - `hmac_secret`: The shared secret for HMAC authentication. This should be
        16 bytes of random data with as much entropy as possible, encoded as a
        base-64 UTF-8 string. Code for generating this in Python can be found
        in the ycmd example client.

    ## HMAC

    All requests to the server must include an HMAC in the x-ycm-hmac HTTP
    header. The HMAC is computed from the shared secret passed to the server
    on startup and the request/response body. The digest algorithm is SHA-256.
    The server will also include the HMAC in its responses; you must verify it
    before using the response. See the example client to see how it's done.

    ## Filetypes

    ycmd uses `filetypes` to identify the "language" of a given buffer. These
    filetype values are strictly the values understood by Vim. Please see the
    YCM README.md for the list of filetypes recognized by ycmd for semantic
    completion.

        The server needs to react to a number of client events in order to

        populating the event name in the `event_name` property:
          - `FileReadyToParse`
            Call when a new buffer is opened or after the user has
            stopped typing for some time, or at any other time when the client
            believes that it is worthwhile reparsing the current file and
            updating semantic engines'' ASTs and reporting things like updated
            diagnostics.
          - `BufferUnload` (optional)
            Call when the user closes a buffer that was previously known to be
            open.
          - `BufferVisit` (optional)
            Call when the user focusses on a buffer that is already known.
            *Note*: The `ultisnips_snippets` property is optional when firing
            calling this event. Otherwise it is ignored.
          - `InsertLeave` (optional)
            For modal editors, call when exiting insert mode. It is equivalent
            to `CurrentIdentifierFinished`.

  /run_completer_command:
    post:
      summary: Run a semantic completer subcommand.
      description: |-
        Semantic completers offer additional engine-specific commands, known
        as completer subcommands. This endpoint requests a specific command to
        be executed. Typically the "default" semantic completer for the current
        filetype is used, but it is possible to force the use of a particular
        completer, using the `completer_target` property.

        The command to execute is passed as a list of arguments, the first of
        which is the command name followed by any command- and
        completer-specific additional arguments. This "command line" is passed
        in the `command_arguments` property.

        The list of available subcommands for a particular semantic compelter
        can be queried using the `/defined_subcommands` endpoint.

        Subcommands may return one of a number of actions, depending on the
        type of command. The following types of response are returned:

        - A *simple display message* response. This is identified where the
          type of the response is scalar (i.e. boolean, number, string) or the
          type of the response is am obkect with a `message` property. These
          messages are typically only a single line and can be displayed in
          a message-box or similarly echoed in a status bar or equivalent.
        - A *FixIt* response. This is identified where the type of the response
          is an object with a property named `fixits`.
        - A *detailed information* response. This is identified where the type
          of the response is an object with a `detailed_info` property. These
          messages are typically multiple lines (such as the documentation and
          signature for a method) and are best displayed in a panel or preview
          area (or equivalent).
        - A *GoTo* response. This is identified where the response type cannot
          be determined by any of the above methods. A GoTo response may contain
          either a single location (e.g. for `GoToDeclaration`), or a list of
          possible locations for the user to chose from (such as in a
          `GoToReferences` subcommand).

    post:
      summary: Get completion suggestions for the current file context.
      description: |-
        Returns the autocompletion suggestions for the current cursor
        position. Typically, the server determines whether or not to use
        semantic completion or general (i.e. identifier-based) completion
        based on the language (filetype) and the context. Clients can force
        the use of semantic completion by setting the `force_semantic`
        property to `true`.

        Note that if `force_semantic` is not set to `true` and the completion
        engine returns an error, the server still tries to fall back to
        general completion, so this endpoint will typically always return
        successfully. Any semantic completer error raised is included in the
        response to be dealt with by the client.

        When `force_semantic` is `true`, any error returned by the semantic
        engine is returned via a 500 response.

      summary: Filter and sort a set of candidates using ycmd's fuzzy matching.
      description: |-
        For filetypes not natively supported by ycmd, clients can often
        determine a set of suitable candidate completion suggestions by other
        means. In Vim this is is typically from the `omnifunc` and other
        clients will have equivalents.

        This endpoint allows clients to use ycmd''s powerful filtering and
        ranking capabilities (including longest-common-subsequence and
        word-boundary-character ranking) on arbitrary sets of identifiers.

        *NOTE:* This API is primarily intended for use when subclassing the
                `Completer` class outside of ycmd which is a very niche case,
                specific to the `OmniCompleter` in the Vim client. It is not
                expected that this API be used elsewhere.
