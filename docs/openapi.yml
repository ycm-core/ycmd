  description: |-
    ycmd is a code-completion & code-comprehension server.

    ycmd presents a JSON/REST interface to clients over HTTP, validated by HMAC.
    An instance of ycmd is started for each client application.

    ## General Notes

    The REST interface typically uses HTTP POST requests and expects the payload
    data to be a valid JSON document. The following general principles are
    applied:

    - All strings going into and out of the server are UTF-8 encoded.
    - All lines end with `\n`.
    - All line and column numbers are 1-based, not 0-based. They are also byte
      offsets, not Unicode codepoint offsets.
    - All file paths are full, absolute paths. If a file has not been written
      to disk yet, supply a temporary path.
    - All requests to the server must include an HMAC in the x-ycm-hmac HTTP
      header.
    - All responses from the server must be validated using the x-ycm-hmac
      header.

    ## The example client

    ycmd contains a simple example client in the `example` directory of the
    source tree. It is written in pure Python with only minimal dependencies.
    It contains trivial implementations of most endpoints and serves to
    supplement this API documentation.

    Consult `example/README.md` for instructions on getting it running.

    ## Starting the server

    The ycmd server is typically started by a client in order to provide
    services to it. Briefly, starting the server requires supplying some
    configuration and initializing some security features (HMAC).

    The server should be started with a supported version of Python.

    The full list of command line options can be obtained by passing `--help`
    to ycmd (e.g. `python -m ycmd --help`). However, the following
    options warrant further discussion:

    ### `--options_file`

    This mandatory option supplies the name of a file containing user options
    data. This option (and thus the file) are mandatory, as they are required
    to set the shared HMAC secret.

    Once the server has read the options, the server deletes the options file.
    Therefore, the client should typically create a secure temporary file (e.g.
    `mkstemp`) which contains the options to be used.

    The default options and their values are found in `default_settings.json`
    within the ycmd codebase.

    The file contains a JSON-formatted object, where the keys are the names of
    options (with any `ycm_` prefix removed) and the values are the option
    values.

    The canonical list of supported user options can be found in
    YouCompleteMe's `README.md`. The option values should have the `ycm_`
    prefix removed.

    The following additional options are required to be set by the client
    application and should *not* be visible to the user:

      - `hmac_secret`: The shared secret for HMAC authentication. This should be
        16 bytes of random data with as much entropy as possible, encoded as a
        base-64 UTF-8 string. Code for generating this in Python can be found
        in the ycmd example client.

    ## HMAC

    All requests to the server must include an HMAC in the x-ycm-hmac HTTP
    header. The HMAC is computed from the shared secret passed to the server
    on startup and the request/response body. The digest algorithm is SHA-256.
    The server will also include the HMAC in its responses; you must verify it
    before using the response. See the example client to see how it's done.

    ## Filetypes

    ycmd uses `filetypes` to identify the "language" of a given buffer. These
    filetype values are strictly the values understood by Vim. Please see the
    YCM README.md for the list of filetypes recognized by ycmd for semantic
    completion.

    description: |-
      Absolute path to the file in the filesystem. If the file does
      not yet exist (for example, a new file), then the value should be an
      arbitrary unique string.
  CompleterTarget:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The completer implementation for which the command is intended. Typically,
      this is set to `filetype_default`, but may also take any of the following
      values:
        - `filetype_default`
          Use the semantic completer associated with the filetype of the current
          buffer. This is the default when a target is not supplied.
        - `identifier`
          Use the identifier completer.
        - Any filetype
          Use the completer associated with the supplied filetype.
  WorkingDirectory:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Absolute path to the filesystem working directory of the client. This is
      used by completer engines to determine things like the project root
      for the file being modified, amongst other things.
  ExtraConfData:
    type: object
    description: |-
      A dictionary passed to the `Settings( **kwargs )` function of the
      `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file under the `client_data` key of `kwargs`. This
      optional field should be used to give users a way to customize the
      `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file with their own set of options.

  FileDataMap:
    type: object
    description: |-
      An object mapping whose keys are the absolute paths to the
      files and whose values are data relating unsaved buffers.

      An unsaved buffer is any file that is opened in the editor and has been
      changed without saving the contents to disk.

      The file referred to in the request `filepath` entry must _always_ be
      included. For most requests this is the user's current buffer, but may
      be any buffer (e.g. in the case of closing a buffer which is not current).

      When a file is closed in the editor, a `BufferUnload` event should be sent
      and the file should not be included in further `FileDataMap` entries
      until (or unless) it is opened and changed again.

    description: |-
      The server raised an exception processing the request. This response is
      often returned when the server is unable to perform the requested action,
      not due to a bug or other error, but because it is not possible to do so.
      For example, it is common for an exception response to be returned when
      requesting "GoToDefinition" on an identifier for which the semantic,
      engine is unable to find such a definition.

      description: |-
        The server needs to react to a number of client events in order to
        provide things like diagnostics and to handle downstream server states
        etc. The client must inform the server of the following events,
        populating the event name in the `event_name` property:
          - `FileReadyToParse`
            Call when a new buffer is opened or after the user has
            stopped typing for some time, or at any other time when the client
            believes that it is worthwhile reparsing the current file and
            updating semantic engines' ASTs and reporting things like updated
            diagnostics.
          - `BufferUnload`
            Call when the user closes a buffer that was previously known to be
            open. Closing buffers is important to limit resource usage.
          - `BufferVisit` (optional)
            Call when the user focusses on a buffer that is already known.
            *Note*: The `ultisnips_snippets` property is optional when firing
            calling this event. Otherwise it is ignored.
          - `InsertLeave` (optional)
            For modal editors, call when exiting insert mode. It is equivalent
            to `CurrentIdentifierFinished`.
          - `CurrentIdentifierFinished` (optional)
            Call when the user finishes typing what appears to the client to be
            an identifier.

      summary: Run a semantic completer subcommand.
      description: |-
        Semantic completers offer additional engine-specific commands, known
        as completer subcommands. This endpoint requests a specific command to
        be executed. Typically the "default" semantic completer for the current
        filetype is used, but it is possible to force the use of a particular
        completer, using the `completer_target` property.

        The command to execute is passed as a list of arguments, the first of
        which is the command name followed by any command- and
        completer-specific additional arguments. This "command line" is passed
        in the `command_arguments` property.

        The list of available subcommands for a particular semantic completer
        can be queried using the `/defined_subcommands` endpoint.

        Subcommands may return one of a number of actions, depending on the
        type of command. The following types of response are returned:

        - A *simple display message* response. This is identified where the
          type of the response is scalar (i.e. boolean, number, string) or the
          type of the response is an object with a `message` property. These
          messages are typically only a single line and can be displayed in
          a message-box or similarly echoed in a status bar or equivalent.
        - A *FixIt* response. This is identified where the type of the response
          is an object with a property named `fixits`.
        - A *detailed information* response. This is identified where the type
          of the response is an object with a `detailed_info` property. These
          messages are typically multiple lines (such as the documentation and
          signature for a method) and are best displayed in a panel or preview
          area (or equivalent).
        - A *GoTo* response. This is identified where the response type cannot
          be determined by any of the above methods. A GoTo response may contain
          either a single location (e.g. for `GoToDeclaration`), or a list of
          possible locations for the user to chose from (such as in a
          `GoToReferences` subcommand).

      summary: Get completion suggestions for the current file context.
      description: |-
        Returns the autocompletion suggestions for the current cursor
        position. Typically, the server determines whether or not to use
        semantic completion or general (i.e. identifier-based) completion
        based on the language (filetype) and the context. Clients can force
        the use of semantic completion by setting the `force_semantic`
        property to `true`.

        Note that if `force_semantic` is not set to `true` and the completion
        engine returns an error, the server still tries to fall back to
        general completion, so this endpoint will typically always return
        successfully. Any semantic completer error raised is included in the
        response to be dealt with by the client.

        When `force_semantic` is `true`, any error returned by the semantic
        engine is returned via a 500 response.

      summary: Filter and sort a set of candidates using ycmd's fuzzy matching.
      description: |-
        For filetypes not natively supported by ycmd, clients can often
        determine a set of suitable candidate completion suggestions by other
        means. In Vim this is typically from the `omnifunc` and other clients
        will have equivalents.

        This endpoint allows clients to use ycmd's powerful filtering and
        ranking capabilities (including longest-common-subsequence and
        word-boundary-character ranking) on arbitrary sets of identifiers.

        *NOTE:* This API is primarily intended for use when subclassing the
                `Completer` class outside of ycmd which is a very niche case,
                specific to the `OmniCompleter` in the Vim client. It is not
                expected that this API be used elsewhere.

        By default, ycmd will not load `.ycm_extra_conf.py` files for security
        reasons and instead raises an exception the first time it requires
        loading.

        API endpoint after confirming with the user that it is safe to load
        the reported `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file.

      description: |-
        Return asynchronous messages from the server. This request is
        used by clients in a "long poll" style, and does not return until
        either:

        - A message (or messages) becomes available, in which case a list of
          messages is returned, or
        - a timeout occurs (after 60s), in which case `true` is returned and
          the client should re-send this request, or
        - for some reason the server determined that the client should stop
          sending `receive_messages` requests, in which case `false` is
          returned, and the client should only send the request again when
          something substantial changes such as a new file type is opened, or
          the completer server is manually restarted.

        The following types of event are delivered asynchronously for certain
        filetypes:

        - Status messages to be displayed unobtrusively to the user.
        - Diagnostics (for Java only).

        This message is optional. Clients do not require to implement this
        method, but it is strongly recommended for certain languages to offer
        the best user experience.
